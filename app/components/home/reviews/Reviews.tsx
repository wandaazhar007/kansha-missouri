                <p className="review-content">Very good food and the owner is very nice. My only complaint is the last time we ordered my husband got the shrimp only and there were only 4 shrimp in the whole meal. Thatâ€™s something I would expect if you got maybe steak or chicken with the shrimp not just shrimp by itself. Thankfully the rice filled him up but it was way too expensive for only veggies, rice and 4 shrimp.</p>

Love the community the owner has, my 5 year old son loves coming to say hi! Vegetarian options: They have a vegetarian hibachi, and I just like getting a side of noodles and side of veggies Kid-friendliness: Outside environment, easy to have kids at the table</p>
